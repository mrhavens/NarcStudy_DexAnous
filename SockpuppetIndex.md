## Canonical Significance

“Dex Anous” is the **first known sockpuppet** used by Joel Johnson in the published record. As such, it marks the **prototype pattern** for later identity-masking strategies. The alias functions as a **reactive mask**, constructed hastily in the wake of perceived ego rupture. Its design lacks structural realism—demonstrating a narcissist's desperation to collapse external narrative coherence.

This case serves as an anchor for triangulating future digital personas by their rhetorical and behavioral echo.
