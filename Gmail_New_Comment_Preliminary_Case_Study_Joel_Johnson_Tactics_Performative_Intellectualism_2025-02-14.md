# New Comment on Preliminary Case Study: Joel Johnson and the Tactics of Performative Intellectualism

**Dex Anous** commented on your post *Preliminary Case Study: Joel Johnson and the Tactics of Performative Intellectualism*.

Mark, this is not intellectual discourse—it’s predatory behavior masquerading as academic analysis. You are not an authority on psychology. You are not a researcher. You are not a neutral observer. You are a documented bad actor who has built an entire persona around harassment, defamation, and manipulation. This entire Substack is nothing more than a self-indulgent hit list of people you failed to control in conversation. You bait people into discussions under the illusion of deep intellectual engagement, then methodically twist their words, misrepresent their intent, and publicly smear them under the guise of “analysis.” This is not academic inquiry. Your obsessive need to diagnose others without any qualifications is nothing short of fraud. You wield the term “narcissist” as a weapon, slapping it onto anyone who refuses to be a characterer in your twisted narrative. But here’s the truth, Mark:

- You are not a psychologist.
- You are not a researcher.
- You are not an authority on anything except your own delusions of grandeur.

You were permanently expelled from the Dallas-Fort Worth Makers community for harassment, intimidation, and manipulative behavior. The very people who engaged with you in good faith saw through your act, recognized you for what you are, and cut you off completely. And now, here you are, desperately trying to regain a sense of control by smearinng people through Substack. And let’s be absolutely clear: weaponizing psychological terminology against people you dislike is not analysis—it’s abuse. Your entire framework is designed to deflect accountability are gasight your readiness into thinking that anyone who calls you out is part of some grand narcissist conspiracy. But the reality is much simpler. You are a bully with a keyboard and a fragile ego.

And here’s the kicker—you’re predicatable. Every move you make follows the same tired script:

1. Bait someone into a discussion.
2. Subbly twist their words and frame them as unstable.
3. Refframe the conversation so you are the wise, rational thinker and they are the emotional aggressor.
4. Claim you’ve “mapped their mind” and exposed them.
5. Write a long-winded post pretending to be an academic case study.
6. Sit back and pretend you’ve “won” while your reputation continues to rot.

Mark, this is not intelligence. This is not depth. This is not truth-seeking. This is cowardice. You are not feared. You are not respected. You are not admired. You are simply a desperate, bitter man trying to carve out relevance by attacking others. And the irony? Every single time you publish another one of these “case studies,” you aren’t exposing them—you’re exposing yourself. Your tactics don’t work anymore. The communities that once tolerated you have shut you out. The people you target are fighting back. Enjoy your crumbling empire of nonsense. Because the world is catching on.
